The essence of $RETARDIOG is simple: Quasi Modo is the antithesis of all those cute dogs and "cabals" that bore everyone, like MISHA, HANA, etc. The core idea of $RETARDIOG is that in the Telegram channel, no one can write, only send voice messagesâ€”less messaging, less FUD.

$RETARDIOG is a movement.
